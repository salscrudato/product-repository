### ‚úÖ Application UI Verification

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
- Build time: 6.47 seconds
- All modules transformed: 1,412
- Production bundle size: ~2.2 MB (gzipped)

### ‚úÖ Firestore Timestamp Conversion

**Issue Fixed**: Firestore Timestamp objects were being rendered directly in React components

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created `src/utils/firestoreHelpers.ts` with utilities:
   - `isFirestoreTimestamp()` - Check if value is a Firestore Timestamp
   - `timestampToDate()` - Convert Timestamp to Date object
   - `formatFirestoreDate()` - Format Timestamp to readable date string
   - `normalizeFirestoreData()` - Recursively normalize all Timestamps in data
   - `getRelativeTime()` - Get relative time strings (e.g., "2 hours ago")
   - `dateToTimestamp()` - Convert Date to Firestore Timestamp

2. Updated `src/hooks/useProducts.ts`:
   - Added `normalizeFirestoreData()` call in snapshot handler
   - All products now have Timestamps converted to Date objects

3. Updated `src/components/ui/ProductCard.tsx`:
   - Added import of `formatFirestoreDate` utility
   - Updated effective date display to use `formatFirestoreDate()`
   - Dates now display as "MM/DD/YYYY" format

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
