## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Firestore Timestamps**: Must be converted to Date objects before rendering in React
2. **Data Normalization**: Recursive normalization handles nested Firestore objects
3. **Idempotent Scripts**: Scripts can be run multiple times safely
4. **Verification**: Always verify data after seeding
5. **UI Integration**: Test data display in actual application

---

## 📞 Support & Next Steps

### If Issues Arise

1. **Timestamp Errors**: Use `formatFirestoreDate()` utility
2. **Data Not Showing**: Run verification script
3. **Build Errors**: Clear node_modules and reinstall
4. **Firebase Issues**: Check `.firebaserc` and authentication

### Future Enhancements

1. Add more insurance products
2. Implement batch seeding for large datasets
3. Add data export functionality
4. Create admin UI for data management
5. Implement data versioning
