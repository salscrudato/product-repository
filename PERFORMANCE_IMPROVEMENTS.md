## 📊 Bundle Analysis Results

**Current Bundle Composition:**
```
Main Bundle: 434.19 kB (gzipped)
PDF.js Chunk: 110.78 kB (gzipped)
Total Chunks: 16 optimized chunks
Load Strategy: Lazy loading with preloading for critical paths
```

**Optimization Achievements:**
- ✅ Proper code splitting across 16 chunks
- ✅ Critical resources preloaded
- ✅ Non-critical components lazy loaded
- ✅ PDF processing isolated in separate chunk
