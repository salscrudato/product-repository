## API Endpoints

### createProductFromPDF Cloud Function

**Mode 1: Extraction Only**
```javascript
{
  pdfBase64: string,
  fileName: string
}
// Returns: { success, extractionResult, message }
```

**Mode 2: Finalized Creation**
```javascript
{
  extractionResult: ExtractionResult,
  isFinalized: true
}
// Returns: { success, productId, extractionResult, message }
```

## Data Models

### ExtractionResult
```typescript
{
  productName: string
  productDescription: string
  productCode?: string
  category?: string
  coverages: CoverageExtraction[]
  metadata: Record<string, any>
  confidence: number (0-100)
  extractionNotes: string
}
```

### CoverageExtraction
```typescript
{
  name: string
  description?: string
  code?: string
  limits?: string
  deductibles?: string
  perilsCovered?: string[]
  exclusions?: string[]
  conditions?: string[]
  parentCoverageName?: string
  confidence: number (0-100)
}
```

### CreationProgress
```typescript
{
  step: 'upload' | 'extract' | 'validate' | 'create_product' | 'create_coverages' | 'complete'
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'error'
  message: string
  progress: number (0-100)
  error?: string
  timestamp: Date
}
```
