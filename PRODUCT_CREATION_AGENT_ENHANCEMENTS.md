## Enhanced Modal Workflow

### Modal Steps

The `ProductCreationAgentModal` now supports 4 distinct steps:

2. **Loading** - Real-time progress with spinner
3. **Review** - Coverage selection and product editing
4. **Complete** - Success confirmation

### Workflow Flow

```
User clicks FAB
    ↓
Modal opens (Upload step)
    ↓
User uploads PDF
    ↓
Modal transitions to Loading step
    ↓
Cloud Function extracts coverages
    ↓
Modal transitions to Review step
    ↓
User edits product info and selects coverages
    ↓
User clicks "Create Product"
    ↓
Modal transitions to Loading step (finalization)
    ↓
Cloud Function creates product with selected coverages
    ↓
Modal transitions to Complete step
    ↓
Auto-navigate to product page after 2 seconds
    ↓

```

## Updated Cloud Function

### Two-Phase Creation

The `createProductFromPDF` Cloud Function now supports two modes:

**Phase 1: Extraction Only**
- Input: `pdfBase64`, `fileName`
- Output: `extractionResult` with all coverages
- Used for review step

**Phase 2: Finalized Creation**
- Input: `extractionResult`, `isFinalized: true`
- Output: Product created in Firestore with selected coverages
- Used after user confirms selections

### New Helper Function

`createFinalizedProduct()` - Handles product creation from extraction result:
- Creates product document
- Creates coverage documents
- Links sub-coverages to parents
- Returns product ID for navigation

## Navigation Integration

After successful product creation:
1. Modal displays success spinner for 2 seconds
2. Auto-navigates to `/coverage/{productId}`
3. User sees newly created product with all coverages
4. Modal closes automatically

## State Management

New state variables in `ProductCreationAgentModal`:

```typescript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<ModalStep>('upload');
const [createdProductId, setCreatedProductId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isCreatingFinalProduct, setIsCreatingFinalProduct] = useState(false);
```

## Files Created

1. **src/components/ui/ProductCreationSpinner.tsx** - Animated progress spinner
