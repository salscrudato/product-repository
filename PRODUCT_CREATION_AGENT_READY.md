## What Was Fixed

### Issue: Modal Closing Instantly
**Root Cause**: Cloud Function was creating product during extraction phase, causing immediate completion and modal closure.

**Solution**: 
- Modified Cloud Function to only extract and return results
- Implemented two-phase workflow:
  - Phase 1: Extract â†’ Return for review
  - Phase 2: Finalize â†’ Create product
- User now sees review screen with extracted data
- User can edit product info and select coverages
- Product only created after user confirmation

### Code Changes
- Renamed `extractionResult` to `extractedResult` to avoid variable conflicts
- Removed immediate product creation from extraction phase
- Added proper logging for debugging
- Enhanced error messages
