- **Features**: Sticky behavior, scroll effects, responsive design, enhanced profile dropdown
- **Profile Integration**: User initials avatar, expanded dropdown with settings/theme toggle placeholders
- **Styling**: Uses styled-components with theme system, NOT Tailwind CSS

### Key Implementation Notes
- Project uses **styled-components** throughout, NOT Tailwind CSS (despite tailwind.config.js existing)
- Navigation is imported as `MainNavigation` from `./ui/Navigation`
- Profile dropdown replaced the old floating profile button from App.js
- All pages should use the consolidated navigation component

### UX/UI Enhancement Details
Based on expert UI/UX feedback, implemented:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Enhanced active states with borders, gradients, and indicators
- **Interaction Feedback**: Smooth hover animations, focus states, and micro-interactions
- **Sticky Navigation**: Scroll-aware shadow effects and responsive behavior
- **Profile Experience**: User initials display, comprehensive dropdown menu
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes

### Component Usage Pattern
```jsx
// Correct way to use navigation in any page component
import MainNavigation from './ui/Navigation';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Page>
      <MainNavigation />
      <MainContent>
        {/* Page content */}
      </MainContent>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

## 0. Project Overview

**Product Hub App** is a P&C insurance product management workbench. Under the hood it:

| Layer | What We Use | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Front-end | React 18 (Create-React-App) + React-Router v6 + styled-components | SPA that admins live in all day |
| Back-end | Firebase ★ Firestore (NoSQL) ★ Storage ★ Auth  | Zero-ops data & file layer |
| AI | OpenAI GPT-4o (via `chat/completions`) | Summaries, chat, rules extraction, coverage diff |
| Parsing | pdf.js in-browser worker | Turns PDFs → raw text |
| Bundling | CRA + Webpack code-split | Instant dev boot, automatic chunking |

---

## 1. Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone git@github.com:<org>/product-hub-app.git
cd product-hub-app

# 2. Install deps
npm i

# 3. Create local env
cp .env.sample .env.local          # fill in the blanks ✍︎
#   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
#   REACT_APP_OPENAI_KEY=...

# 4. Run
npm start                          # http://localhost:3000
```

## 2. High-Level Data Model (Firestore)

```
products (collection)
└─ {productId}
   ├─ name, formNumber, productCode, effectiveDate, formDownloadUrl
   ├─ coverages (sub-collection)          1‑‑‑n
   │   └─ {coverageId}
   │      • name, coverageCode, category, limits[], deductibles[], states[], parentCoverageId?, formIds[]
   ├─ steps (sub-collection)              1‑‑‑n
   │   └─ {stepId}
   │      • stepName, coverages[], states[], value, rounding, order, stepType("factor"|"operand")
   └─ versionHistory (sub-collection)     audit log
forms (collection)                        m‑to‑n with products & coverages                    
└─ {formId}
   • formName, formNumber, productIds[], coverageIds[], downloadUrl
formCoverages (collection)                join table
└─ {linkId}
   • productId, coverageId, formId
```

> **Rules of thumb:**  
> • Coverage names are human‑friendly; *coverageCode* is the immutable identifier.  
> • `formCoverages` is the source‑of‑truth link – the arrays on Coverage/Form are denormalised for speed.  
> • Every destructive action must also write to `versionHistory`.

## 6. AI Workflow Cheatsheet

| Feature          | Prompt file / system role                        | API model | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Form summary** | `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS` in _ProductHub.js_         | `gpt-4o`  | First 100 k tokens of PDF |
| **Product chat** | Same as above (+ conversational wrapper)         | `gpt-4o`  | Persists per‑product chat log |
| **Rules extract**| `RULES_SYSTEM_PROMPT`                            | `gpt-4o`  | Returns JSON of Product & Rating rules |
| **Form diff**    | `COMPARE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`                          | `gpt-4o`  | Local diff via coverage lists |

All responses are parsed client‑side.  **Store** summaries & rules in Firestore once generated to avoid burning tokens.

## 7. Bulk Operations

| Entity      | Export → Excel | Import ← Excel | Key points |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Coverages   | ✔ (`Export XLSX`) | ✔ (merge by `coverageCode`) | Handles hierarchy, 50‑state matrix |
| Pricing Steps| ✔ | ✔ (append) | Rows = factors, "CALCULATION" column holds next operand |
| Forms       | ☐ (TBD) | ✔ (multifile uploader) | Linking to coverages done post‑upload |
| States      | Covered in coverage sheet columns | — | Product‑level state list managed in UI |

---

## 8. Dev Practices

1. **Branch naming**: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
2. **Commit msg** *(Conventional Commits)*:
   ```
   feat(navigation): enhance UX with sticky behavior and profile dropdown
   ```
3. **PR checklist**: tests passing, ESLint clean, screenshots for UI.
4. **Version bump**: update `CHANGELOG` section below via PR.
5. **Env vars** live in `.env.local` – never commit secrets.

---

## 9. Deploy / Hosting

| Environment | Firebase Project | URL |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| **dev**     | `product-hub-dev` | Automatic on every push to `develop` |
| **prod**    | `product-hub-prod`| Manual via `npm run deploy` |

CI is GitHub Actions → Firebase Hosting.  See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting FAQ

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| ⛔ **CORS 403** on PDF GET | Missing storage rules in dev | `firebase deploy --only storage` |
| AI call 400 "context length" | PDF too big | Chunk size & retry in `ProductHub.handleSummary` |
| Duplicate coverage in import | `coverageCode` not unique | Deduplicate in sheet or rename code |
| Navigation not showing | Using old component | Import `MainNavigation` from `./ui/Navigation` |
| Profile dropdown missing | Old App.js profile code | Use new integrated navigation component |
