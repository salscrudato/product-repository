## 2. High-Level Data Model (Firestore)

```
products (collection)
└─ {productId}
   ├─ name, formNumber, productCode, effectiveDate, formDownloadUrl
   ├─ coverages (sub-collection)          1‑‑‑n
   │   └─ {coverageId}
   │      • name, coverageCode, category, limits[], deductibles[], states[], parentCoverageId?, formIds[]
   ├─ steps (sub-collection)              1‑‑‑n
   │   └─ {stepId}
   │      • stepName, coverages[], states[], value, rounding, order, stepType("factor"|"operand")
   └─ versionHistory (sub-collection)     audit log
forms (collection)                        m‑to‑n with products & coverages                    
└─ {formId}
   • formName, formNumber, productIds[], coverageIds[], downloadUrl
formCoverages (collection)                join table
└─ {linkId}
   • productId, coverageId, formId
```

> **Rules of thumb:**  
> • Coverage names are human‑friendly; *coverageCode* is the immutable identifier.  
> • `formCoverages` is the source‑of‑truth link – the arrays on Coverage/Form are denormalised for speed.  
> • Every destructive action must also write to `versionHistory`.

## 7. Claims Analysis System

### Overview
The Claims Analysis feature provides AI-powered claim coverage determination by analyzing claim scenarios against selected insurance forms. It uses advanced PDF processing and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini to deliver expert-level claims analysis.

### Key Features

#### Multi-Form Selection
- **Smart Form Browser**: Search and filter forms by name, number, or category
- **Multi-Select Interface**: Choose multiple forms for comprehensive policy analysis
- **Real-time Selection Count**: Visual feedback on selected forms
- **Form Metadata Display**: Shows form numbers, categories, and types

#### Intelligent PDF Processing
- **Automatic Text Extraction**: Uses pdf.js to extract text from uploaded PDFs
- **Smart Chunking**: Handles large documents by splitting into manageable chunks
- **Overlap Management**: Ensures context continuity between chunks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when PDFs can't be processed

#### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Expert System Prompt**: Specialized prompt for P&C insurance claims analysis
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent format with coverage determination, reasoning, and recommendations
- **Multi-Form Synthesis**: Combines analysis from multiple forms into coherent determination
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple questions

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components
- `src/components/ClaimsAnalysis.js` - Main interface component
- `src/services/claimsAnalysisService.js` - AI analysis logic
- `src/utils/pdfChunking.js` - PDF processing utilities

#### PDF Chunking Strategy
```javascript
// Handles large PDFs by splitting into chunks
const chunks = chunkText(text, maxTokens=3000, overlap=200);
// Processes multiple forms with metadata preservation
const formChunks = await processFormsForAnalysis(selectedForms);
```

#### AI Analysis Flow
1. **Form Processing**: Extract and chunk text from selected PDFs
2. **Context Building**: Create comprehensive context from all form chunks
3. **Claim Analysis**: Send claim scenario + context to OpenAI GPT-4o
4. **Response Synthesis**: For large form sets, synthesize multiple analyses
5. **Structured Output**: Return formatted coverage determination

### Usage Workflow

1. **Navigate to Claims Analysis**: Use main navigation menu
2. **Select Forms**: Choose relevant policy forms from the searchable list
3. **Describe Claim**: Enter claim scenario in the chat interface
4. **Review Analysis**: Get structured coverage determination with reasoning
5. **Ask Follow-ups**: Continue conversation for clarification or additional scenarios

### Response Format
The AI provides structured responses including:
- **Coverage Determination**: COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIALLY COVERED
- **Summary**: Brief overview of the determination
- **Applicable Coverages**: Specific coverages that apply
- **Relevant Exclusions**: Exclusions that might apply
- **Analysis Details**: Detailed reasoning with policy citations
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for claim handling

## 8. Bulk Operations

| Entity      | Export → Excel | Import ← Excel | Key points |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Coverages   | ✔ (`Export XLSX`) | ✔ (merge by `coverageCode`) | Handles hierarchy, 50‑state matrix |
| Pricing Steps| ✔ | ✔ (append) | Rows = factors, "CALCULATION" column holds next operand |
| Forms       | ☐ (TBD) | ✔ (multifile uploader) | Linking to coverages done post‑upload |
| States      | Covered in coverage sheet columns | — | Product‑level state list managed in UI |

## 8. Dev Practices

1. **Branch naming**: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
2. **Commit msg** *(Conventional Commits)*:
   ```
   feat(navigation): enhance UX with sticky behavior and profile dropdown
   ```
3. **PR checklist**: tests passing, ESLint clean, screenshots for UI.
4. **Version bump**: update `CHANGELOG` section below via PR.
5. **Env vars** live in `.env.local` – never commit secrets.

## 9. Deploy / Hosting

| Environment | Firebase Project | URL |
|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| **dev**     | `product-hub-dev` | Automatic on every push to `develop` |
| **prod**    | `product-hub-prod`| Manual via `npm run deploy` |

CI is GitHub Actions → Firebase Hosting.  See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## 10. Troubleshooting FAQ

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| ⛔ **CORS 403** on PDF GET | Missing storage rules in dev | `firebase deploy --only storage` |
| AI call 400 "context length" | PDF too big | Chunk size & retry in `ProductHub.handleSummary` |
| Duplicate coverage in import | `coverageCode` not unique | Deduplicate in sheet or rename code |
| Navigation not showing | Using old component | Import `MainNavigation` from `./ui/Navigation` |
| Profile dropdown missing | Old App.js profile code | Use new integrated navigation component |
