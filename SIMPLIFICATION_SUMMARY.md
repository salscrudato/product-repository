## Next Steps

### Recommended Optimizations
1. **Bundle Analysis**: Run `npm run build` and analyze bundle size
2. **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting
3. **Dependency Audit**: Review remaining dependencies for further optimization
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and memory usage
5. **User Testing**: Validate simplified UX with users

### Potential Further Simplifications
1. **PDF Processing**: Consider lighter alternatives to pdfjs-dist
2. **State Management**: Evaluate if Redux/Context could simplify state
3. **Component Consolidation**: Look for similar components that could be merged
4. **Utility Functions**: Consolidate similar utility functions

## Conclusion
