## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Error: "PDF text is required"**

**What it means:** The Cloud Function didn't receive the PDF text

**How to fix:**
1. Check browser console for payload info
2. Verify the PDF URL is accessible
3. Try a smaller PDF
4. Check Cloud Function logs

**Command to check logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log
```

---

### **Error: "Failed to load resource: 500"**

**What it means:** Cloud Function encountered an error

**How to fix:**
1. Check Cloud Function logs:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```

2. Verify functions are deployed:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. Check OpenAI API key is valid:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   cat .env | grep OPENAI_KEY
   ```

---

### **Error: "Authentication required"**

**What it means:** User is not logged in

**How to fix:**
1. Sign in to the application
2. Refresh the page
3. Try the action again

---

### **Error: "Payload too large"**

**What it means:** PDF text exceeds 9MB limit

**How to fix:**
1. Use a smaller PDF
2. Or split the PDF into multiple parts
3. Or increase the limit in the code (not recommended)

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### **Expected Response Times:**

| Feature | Expected Time | Acceptable Range |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Home Chat | 3-5 seconds | 2-10 seconds |
| PDF Summary | 15-30 seconds | 10-60 seconds |
| Product Chat | 3-5 seconds | 2-10 seconds |
| Claims Analysis | 5-10 seconds | 3-15 seconds |

### **If Response Times Are Slow:**
- Check internet connection
- Check Cloud Function cold start (first request is slower)
- Check PDF size (larger PDFs take longer)
- Check OpenAI API status: https://status.openai.com/
